        <p><strong><em>This great city is located in Colombia.</em></strong> There are a lot of good places for relaxing there. <br> First of all, we have the Nevado of Ruiz that is a huge volcain near the city. We also have the Catedral, that is a beautiful church in the downtown. Some images:</p>
